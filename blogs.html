                <p>
                    A Broader Perspective for Learning. Art and creative expression have an interesting way of weaving
                    in and out of classrooms, offering students the opportunity to explore their own ideas and minds.
                    Video games are no different, and while most of the discussion about their use in classrooms centers
                    on play, we at foundry10 wanted to examine the value of making games. Through easily accessible
                    programs such as Scratch and Gamemaker, students from early elementary up through college are
                    creating games and learning while doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We gathered surveys from 107 game design and development professionals and 300 middle school
                    students, before and after a game development class, about the value of teaching game dev. in
                    a middle school class. Then we compared the responses of the 7th- and 8th-graders with what the game
                    developers said they felt would be important about making games. We hope this information will help
                    teachers who are constructing game development classes, and show the broader view of the value
                    inherent in game development that professional game makers can provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making computer games can be a great entry point into computer science. Writing code is a major part
                    of making video games, and 58 percent of the professionals surveyed said that programming was a key
                    element of game development. However, they were quick to point out that the great thrill of
                    programming for game development is to make games enjoyable for others who want to develop such
                    games.
                </p>

                <img src="https://www.goodworklabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/8_The-future-of-Open-Source-Game-Development.jpg"
                    alt="game dev">

                <p>
                    This consideration for how others experience games is at the heart of game development, in the form
                    of both imagining another's experience of the game and direct feedback by users. It's not coding
                    just to code, it is coding to create something fun for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Game creation is an art of understanding and bending perception of a user... Even if it is
                    ultimately used outside the scope of game creation." — Game developer
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students indicated that coding was an enjoyable aspect of their course. Oddly, they often didn't
                    recognize the games they were creating were made for their classmates to play. This seems to be a
                    key component of a game development course, as reflected by the professionals' experience in the
                    field. Perhaps highlighting this aspect for students would add to their experience in a positive
                    way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the survey, 35 percent of the professionals mentioned creativity, design and the arts as inherent
                    to the value of making games. Also, 44 percent said they thought these concepts should be emphasized
                    in a middle school game creation course. A much smaller percentage of students, 10 percent of 7th
                    graders and 3 percent of 8th graders, said they saw creativity and the arts as a valuable component
                    of game development whereas only 6 percent of the 8th graders said they felt these skills were
                    gained. Game development is an excellent opportunity for students to express themselves creatively.
                    It seems that emphasizing the importance of the more creative and artistic elements might serve to
                    enhance students' overall experience and understanding of what it means to make games.

                    Hello Guys, I hope you are doing great in 2019. I am sure you all have already made your goals by
                    now and thinking about how to achieve those goals. If one of your goals is to learn to code or to
                    become a Web Developer in 2019 then I have something great to share with you today, the 2019 Web
                    Developer RoadMap. This is an excellent illustration on how to become a web developer in 2019 and
                    guide you on how you can learn and master Web Development in 2019. It’s a collection of different
                    paths to learning front-end, back-end, and all other things a Web developer should know. You will
                    not just know about web development but about essential programming stuff which is important for all
                    kind of programmers. The RoadMap is also divided into 3 sections, the first section is about common
                    skills which every web developer should know, while the second and third section is about front-end
                    and back-end development, two main areas of web development. You can either learn Front-end or
                    Back-end or both, depending upon your choice. If you want to become a FullStack Web developer then
                    you have to learn both front-end and back-end, there is no escaping there. In Frontend also you can
                    choose to learn the framework you want like React, Angular or Vue.js, you don’t need to learn them
                    all but learn the one you like. If you ask for my recommendation, Vue.js is a better choice in 2019
                    than the other two but again those are more used than Vue.js yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Web Development Basics - It’s pretty obvious that if you want to become a Web Developer then you
                    should know the basics of internet, web applications, protocols like HTTP and web development in
                    general. Thankfully there are a lot of courses where you can not only learn these but much more than
                    that.
                </p>

                <img src="https://hackernoon.com/hn-images/1*niEyT-1QT1Zfs-dweauqJA.jpeg" alt="web dev-2">

                <p>
                    Front-End :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HTML and CSS - HTML and CSS are the backbones of any website. HTML provides the structure while
                        CSS provides the
                        style and help them to look better and more visually appealing. If you want to become a serious
                        frontend developer then you must master these two and to start with, you can check these free
                        HTML
                        and CSS courses to learn online.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        JavaScript - Just like four pillars of object-oriented programming, I mean Abstraction,
                        Encapsulation,
                        Polymorphism, and Inheritance, there are three main pillars of web development, namely — HTML,
                        CSS,
                        and JavaScript. The first two provides structure and style but it’s the JavaScript which makes
                        them alive by adding
                        interactiveness. It’s extremely important for a modern Java developer to learn JavaScript and
                        thankfully there are many courses which you can look to learn both beginner and advanced
                        JavaScript,
                        here are some recommendations:
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Angular - Gone are the days when people build websites using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        Nowadays most of
                        the work is done by a framework like Angular, React JS or Vue.js. They not only provide a
                        structure for storing your code but also makes it easy to develop a web
                        application in quick time. Angular is backed by Google, hence learning Angular is a good choice
                        for any modern Web Developer.
                        If you want to learn Angular there is no better course than Max’s Angular 7 (formerly Angular
                        2) — The Complete Guide on Udemy.
                    </li>


                    <li>React JS - Similar to Angular, React is also a popular library for developing web applications.
                        It allows you
                        to write reusable components which you can then use to create modern looking interactive web
                        pages. Like Angular is backed by Google, React is backed by Facebook and hence quite popular. If
                        you want
                        to learn React then you either join Stephen Grider’s Modern React with Redux or Max’s
                        React — The
                        Complete Guide on Udemy. Both are excellent courses to learn to React online.

                    Back-End :
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Node.js - There are many choices to develop your web application’s backend e.g. you can use Java
                        and Spring or
                        maybe Python + Django but in recent year Node.js has come up as the preferred option. The best
                        thing about NodeJS is that it allows you to develop a complete web application using just one
                        programming language — JavaScript. If you want to go Node route, then The Complete Node.js
                        Developer course by Rob Percival and Andrew Mead
                        is best to start with.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Java - I am primarily a Java developer who have learned Web Development and other programming
                        languages, hence
                        when it comes to developing backend my preferred choice is Java. You can either use Core Java or
                        Java + Spring Boot to write a cutting edge, high-performance backend. If you want to go Java and
                        Spring route,
                        here are a couple of courses you can join to get up-to-speed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Python - Python is another awesome language, full of powerful framework and libraries. If you
                        want to develop
                        backend using Python then you can use Django, a full-stack web development framework for Python
                        programmers.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Ruby - Ruby is another powerful language perfect for web development. It has got a great
                        framework called Rails which makes creating Web applications really easy and fast. If you want
                        to start with Ruby you can check out The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course on Udemy.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        PHP and MySQL - Forget about whatever negative things people say about PHP. It is still the
                        easiest way to write the
                        server side code and many, almost 50% of the internet runs on PHP and MySQL stack. If you are
                        interested in learning PHP, you can check out PHP for Beginners course on Udemy. If you need
                        more choices and free resources, you can also check my list of free PHP and MySQL courses to
                        start with.

                <p>
                    C - C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie as a system
                    programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level
                    access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable
                    for system programming like operating system or compiler development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive
                    programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++ runs on lots
                    of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java - Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language. Java has been one of
                    the most popular programming language for many years.
                    Java is Object Oriented. However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support
                    for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)
                    The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code). Then the byte code is
                    run on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
                    Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low level programming functionalities
                    like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of classes and objects.
                    Java is used in all kind of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is Java based), desktop
                    applications, web applications, client server applications, enterprise applications and many more.
                    When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not allow many
                    things which may lead bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For example, non-primitives
                    are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects (like we can do in C++) to functions,
                    we always pass references in Java. One more example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access
                    is also not possible.
                    When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs written in Java
                    typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than C++. Like C++, Java does
                    static type checking, but Python does not.

                    Python - Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python
                    programming
                    language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along
                    with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. Python Programming Language is very well
                    suited for Beginners, also for experienced programmers with other programming languages like C++ and
                    Java. Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:

                <ul>
                    <li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
                    <li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
                    <li>
                        Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers
                        have
                        to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the
                        time.

                        to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the
                        time.

                    Artificial intelligence (AI) is wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building
                    smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI is an
                    interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, but advancements in machine learning and deep
                    learning are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allied Forces
                    win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history a second time with a simple question:
                    "Can machines think?". Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950), and it's
                    subsequent Turing Test, established the fundamental goal and vision of artificial intelligence.

                <p>
                    What is artificial intelligence? At it's core, AI is the branch of computer science that aims to
                    answer Turing's question in the affirmative. It is the endeavor to replicate or simulate human
                    intelligence in machines. The expansive goal of artificial intelligence has given rise to many
                    questions and debates. So much so, that no singular definition of the field is universally accepted.
                    The major limitation in defining AI as simply "building machines that are intelligent" is that it
                    doesn't actually explain what artificial intelligence is? What makes a machine intelligent? In their
                    groundbreaking textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, authors Stuart Russell and Peter
                    Norvig approach the question by unifying their work around the theme of intelligent agents in
                    machines. With this in mind, AI is "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment
                    and perform actions." (Russel and Norvig viii). Norvig and Russell go on to explore four different
                    approaches that have historically defined the field of AI: Thinking humanly, Thinking rationally,
                    Acting humanly and Acting rationally.

                <p>
                    The first two ideas concern thought processes and reasoning, while the others deal with behavior.
                    Norvig and Russell focus particularly on rational agents that act to achieve the best outcome,
                    noting "all the skills needed for the Turing Test also allow an agent to act rationally." (Russel
                    and Norvig 4). Patrick Winston, the Ford professor of artificial intelligence and computer science
                    at MIT, defines AI as "algorithms enabled by constraints, exposed by representations that support
                    models targeted at loops that tie thinking, perception and action together."
                </p>
                <p>
                    While addressing a crowd at the Japan AI Experience in 2017, DataRobot CEO Jeremy Achin began his
                    speech by offering the following definition of how AI is used today: "AI is a computer system able
                    to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. Many of these artificial intelligence
                    systems are powered by machine learning, some of them are powered by deep learning and some of them
                    are powered by very boring things like rules."

                <p>
                    First, you need to create your development environment so that your desktop is ready to support your
                    Android development goals. For that, you will need Android Studio and the Android SDK. Thankfully,
                    these both come packaged together in a single download that you can find here. Android Studio is an
                    IDE. That stands for “integrated development environment,” which is essentially an interface where
                    you can enter your code (primarily Java or Kotlin) and access all the different tools necessary for
                    development. Android Studio allows you to access libraries and APIs from the Android SDK, thereby
                    giving you access to native functions of the operating system. You’ll also be able to build your app
                    into an APK using Gradle, test it via a “virtual device” (emulator), and debug your code while it
                    runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have Android Studio on your machine, the next step is to start a new project. This is a
                    straightforward process, but you’ll need to make a few decisions that will impact on your Android
                    app development going forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest decisions you’ll need to make as an Android developer is whether you’re going to
                    learn Kotlin or Java. Both languages are officially supported by Google and Android Studio, but they
                    have some distinct differences. Java has been supported by Google the longest and is what developers
                    have been using to craft Android apps for years. Java is also one of the most in-demand programming
                    languages in the world, which makes it a great choice for those who want to begin a career in
                    development. As the oldest Android programming language, there is also slightly more support for
                    Java vs Kotlin, although it’s not by much.Kotlin on the other hand has become Google’s preferred
                    choice for Android development. This is the default when starting a new app, and it is likely to
                    become more common going forward. Kotlin is also significantly easier to get to grips with if you’re
                    a complete beginner. For these reasons, Kotlin is probably the language of choice for Android
                    developers that are learning for fun, or that have no aspirations to develop for other platforms.
                    However, Java makes more sense if you’re interested in becoming a professional developer.
                    Swift is another language you can use but again that is also based on Java itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of this code is to tell Android where the associated layout file is. A layout file is
                    slightly different from a Kotlin/Java file. This defines the way that an activity looks, and lets
                    you add things like buttons, text, and browser windows. You’ll find this file in: MyApplication >
                    app > src > res > layout. It will be called activity_main.xml. Note that files stored in the
                    resources folder can’t use capitals; they need to use the underscore symbol to distinguish different
                    words. Double click on this file and it will open in the main window where you edit your code.
                    Notice that you can switch between the open files using tabs along the top.

                    For any and every need today, one can find numerous mobile applications out there. There are
                    individuals and studios coming up with novel ideas to stay ahead in a field that is already hyper
                    competitive. As a coder, if mobile app development is what you feel is your calling, here’s a
                    detailed guide to what you must do to create a successful career off it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first step is to figure out the app’s purpose. With so many out there, it is important that your
                    app stands out, even if it solves a problem that already has solutions. For example, you may want to
                    make a new picture editing app. There is going to be a lot of competition no matter how well-made it
                    is. Go back to the drawing board if your idea isn’t adding any value to what is already available.
                    After you are done figuring out what the app is going to do, the next step is to choose a platform
                    for your app, that is, whether you want it to work on Android or iOS. Other operating systems do
                    exist but these happen to be the two most widely used ones currently. The programming language for
                    iOS is Objective-C and C, while for Android, it is Java.

                    Step Up -
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Browse through the respective app stores and get a deeper understanding of what you wish to
                        solve. Research is a significant step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Make a list of all the functionalities your app would have. Going back to the picture editor
                        example, you could want an option to crop, an option to improve brightness and a few preset
                        filters.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Design how each of your app’s functionalities will work and how the end user will interact.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Coding the app.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test your app, and get a select few to use it. Get feedback and improve till the end product
                        works fine. This step is necessary to quash bugs if any.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Uploading to the platform it is designed for.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Making an app is time consuming but if you are already a developer with the knowhow of necessary
                    programming languages, it doesn’t cost you much to make a basic one. To get your apps listed on the
                    Google store, you just need to pay a one-time fee of $25 while for Apple store, you are charged $100
                    a year. One part of the reason why Apple charges more is because it is not quite easy to get your
                    app on their store. If you build an app that doesn’t need the internet for any of its
                    functionalities to work, it means you do not really need to rent out storage space on the cloud.
                    Otherwise, you might need to pay up a little for cloud, which could amount to as little as $5 a
                    month. One of the most common ways to monetize apps are in-app ads. Another way of monetizing is
                    in-app purchases. You could keep some functionalities free and once you have a loyal user, see if a
                    few exclusive paid features can make them pay. Subscriptions or completely paid apps are also
                    popular, but you need to really be offering something different to get people to buy it.

                    To crack passwords or to steal data? No, it is much more than that. Ethical hacking is to scan
                    vulnerabilities and to find potential threats on a computer or networks. An ethical hacker finds the
                    weak points or loopholes in a computer, web applications or network and reports them to the
                    organization. So, let’s explore more about Ethical Hacking step-by-step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    White Hat Hackers: Here, we look for bugs and ethically report it to the organization. We are
                    authorized as a user to test for bugs in a website or network and report it to them. White hat
                    hackers generally get all the needed information about the application or network to test for, from
                    the organization itself. They use their skills to test it before the website goes live or attacked
                    by malicious hackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Black Hat Hackers: Here, the organization doesn’t allow the user to test it. They unethically enter
                    inside the website and steal data from the admin panel or manipulate the data. They only focus on
                    themselves and the advantages they will get from the personal data for personal financial gain. They
                    can cause major damage to the company by altering the functions which lead to the loss of the
                    company at a much higher extent. This can even lead you to extreme consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Grey Hat Hackers: They sometimes access to the data and violates the law. But never have the same
                    intention as Black hat hackers, they often operate for the common good. The main difference is that
                    they exploit vulnerability publicly whereas white hat hackers do it privately for the company.

                    Go through the “Spam” section of your Email. What do you see?? You might have won a brand new Audi
                    or a mind-boggling amount in a lottery that you didn’t even purchase, asking for credit card
                    details. Or your bank might be asking to verify your account details via email in urgency. Do you
                    see things similar to the above cases in your spam section? This is where Phishing comes into
                    picture. Phishing is a type of Social Engineering attack that aims to obtain sensitive information
                    including the bank account number, usernames, passwords, and credit card details. It is mostly done
                    by sending fake emails that appear to have come from a legitimate source, or it can be in the form
                    of Vishing. The recipient is mostly manipulated to click a malicious link that can install malware
                    or access sensitive information. Or it can simply be a case of Typosquatting that redirects the
                    recipient to a malicious website in order to obtain login credentials.

                    vulnerable virtual machines, and test servers. There are many free and paid options for hypervisors
                    provided by many vendors. For example, VMware has VMWare workstation, Oracle has Oracle VirtualBox
                    and Microsoft has HyperV. You can choose any of these depending on your choice and budget.
                    Guest Operating Systems: Guest operating systems will include unpatched versions of Windows and
                    Linux. These will be installed to test for zero-days and other vulnerabilities for which patches, as
                    well as exploits, have been released.
                    Vulnerable VMs: Vulnerable Virtual Machines are developed intentionally for being highly vulnerable.
                    Most of the VMs are parts of hacking events and are released later online. These VMs are usually
                    CTFs with hidden strings that are to be found after compromising (pwning) the VM. Some popular
                    vulnerable VMs are Metasploitable, OWASP broken web application, DVWA(Damn Vulnerable Web
                    Application), BadStore, De-Ice, and Multidae, etc.

                    Essential Tools: Once you have found and installed your favorite vulnerable assets, it is now time
                    to get the tools required for pwning them. Install these tools on your computer to get started.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Metasploit Framework (MSF): An open-source version of the Metasploit tool is used extensively
                        for exploiting known vulnerabilities in systems and software. The exploit list is updates
                        regularly with exploits of most recent findings that went public.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        WireShark: It is a tool used by network administrators but you can use it to supplement your
                        hacking tools arsenal. For you as a hacker(ethical, of course) this tool will help in network
                        pentesting by the same basic feature of network monitoring :it can help you harvest sensitive
                        data like plaintext passwords over unencrypted connections(http, telnet), analyze malware
                        behavior by figuring out the endpoints it tries to connect, and many more.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Nmap: One tool to rule ’em all, it is used by almost every penetration tester. It is a port
                        scanner with a set of additional utilities like OS detection and network mapping(nmap stands for
                        “network mapper” ). It can be automated by writing scripts in NSE(nmap scripting environment).
                        Port scans are used to enumerate services and applications on the target. These enumeration data
                        can be really useful in some cases for pwning the target.
