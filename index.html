                    Most of these technologies will be related to computers, smartphones, security systems etc. Some of
                    these articles will be about older technologies like the core programmming languages of C and C++
                    which
                    were the base on which all the modern computer and smartphone technogies like softwares, apps and
                    other
                    languages were built. The remaining articles will cover all the other modern technologies like AI
                    and ML
                    which are so accustomed to seeing and hearing about in our day to day life.

                    Moreover internet also helps to keep friends and families closer. The use of internet is rising
                    rapidly.
                    The world-wide-web connects over 100 million people around the world. The use of internet has also
                    improved our means of communication. We can talk by face to our friends and relatives anytime
                    anywhere
                    in the world by using the web cameras. It helps to keep touch us with each other either we are too
                    far
                    away. We can send picture, text and important information through e-mail service. How can we forget
                    the
                    role of internet in education system? It is a source of knowledge and entertainment. The new
                    researches

                    for
                    preparing their projects and assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, some universities and college offer online courses for higher education. For example in
                    England open universities courses are beneficial for the students who canâ€™t afforded the higher fee
                    of
                    universities. The students who do the jobs and women at home who could not continue their study
                    because
                    of their family problems can easily do their study as well as their jobs. So our education standard
                    increased due to the innovation in technology. An individual can gain knowledge through internet
                    about
                    any topic at any place and at any point of time.
